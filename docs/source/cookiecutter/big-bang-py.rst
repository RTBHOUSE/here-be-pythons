Big-Bang-py
===========

To start your new Python project, it is recommended to use `Big-Bang-py <https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py>`_ Cookiecutter, as it follows the ideas and principles of Here-Be-Pythons!

Moreover, it is maintained by the very same authors 😊, so both projects are promised to be kept in sync 💫.


Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

   # Generate a new project.
   cookiecutter gh:RTBHOUSE/big-bang-py

   # Answer all of the prompted questions.
   # Brackets show default options. Click <enter> if you wish to accept them.
   project_name [My New Project]: ???
   project_dir  [my-new-project]: ???
   project_source_code_dir [src]: ???

   # Go to your new project folder.
   cd $MY_NEW_PROJECT_DIR

   # Run the script below:
   ./finish_project_setup

Voilà! You are ready to code!
